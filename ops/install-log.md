## 2026-10-15 — Oracle VM — gcalcli (calendar)
Host: Oracle VM, Ubuntu 24.04 arm64 (hostname not recorded here).
- Removed the apt package gcalcli 4.3.0 (it has no `init` command).
- Installed pipx and python3-venv. Ran `pipx ensurepath`. Added `~/.local/bin` to PATH in `~/.bashrc`.
- `pipx install gcalcli` gave version 4.5.1.
- Created the Google Cloud OAuth client (Desktop app). Values kept in the password manager.
- Authenticated with `gcalcli --client-id=... init` through an SSH tunnel to the redirect port.
- Read test: `gcalcli list` and `gcalcli agenda` passed.
- Write test: added "LifeOS write test" to the primary calendar at 17:00. Visible in agenda. Deletion from the web app still to confirm.
- ACTION (owner: CEO): the client secret appeared in a chat transcript. Reset it in Google Cloud Console and update the password manager. Status: open until reset is confirmed.
