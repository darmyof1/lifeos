## P-09 - Spikes not yet run
Planned: SPK-01 to SPK-04 and SPK-07. Done: SPK-06 (see file), SPK-09 (see file). Partial: SPK-05 (see file).
Several need the OpenClaw runtime running on the VM. Run them when the system is up.
Runbook: guides/vm-spike-runbook.md. Order: SPK-07, SPK-01, SPK-02, SPK-03, SPK-04. SPK-07 done (research/spikes/SPK-07-gpg-restore-drill.md). SPK-01 done for the mechanism; limits recorded in its file (research/spikes/SPK-01-egress-interception.md). SPK-02 done: state honours the override (setup, status, gateway); logs do not (research/spikes/SPK-02-openclaw-state-dir.md). SPK-03 partial: agents and workspaces set up; isolation-off canary not obtained on this VM; isolation-on deferred (research/spikes/SPK-03-agent-isolation.md). SPK-04 Part A done: two Slack identities; each agent posts as its bound account (research/spikes/SPK-04-slack-multi-identity.md). Part B and the leakage check open. Cleanup verified 2026-10-19 (top-level tokens removed; gateway token saved). Model: utility and main set to openai/gpt-6-luna; served and billed gpt-6-luna after the change. Billing re-check 2026-10-20 (life-os chip set): gpt-6-luna about $0.04 for the day, gpt-5_6-luna $0. Billing confirmed for the test. Channel allowlist, event subscription and spk04-b binding verified 2026-10-20. Part B (local model) paused: /new refused as control-command-unauthorized; a thread turn used openai/gpt-6-luna; llama3.1-32k context fix not yet verified. Send back the results; the spike files are filled in after each run.

## P-17 - Dashboard or website for the owner (future)
Owner: CMO (roster: "produces the weekly life dashboard"). Proposed, not yet approved: the CKO supplies the memory data behind it.
Decision made: the owner must be able to reach it from the internet. It will be heavily protected. How it is protected is decided later.
Not now: no design until the agent loop is proven.
Needs: nothing today. A design item is opened when the loop is proven.
